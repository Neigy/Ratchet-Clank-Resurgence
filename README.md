Modding project for Ratchet &amp; Clank PS3 titles, enhancing gameplay and visuals.

## Introduction

**Ratchet & Clank: Resurgence** is a modding project born from my passion for the Ratchet & Clank games on PS3, which have been a significant part of my childhood. After years of playing these titles, I felt the need to give them a second life by introducing modifications and improvements.
 The main goal of this project is to reignite the community's interest in these games and provide a refreshed experience for both fans and new players.

While working on this project, I hope not only to bring joy to the community but also to learn and enjoy the development process. This project is, above all, a tribute to games that have meant a lot to me, and I hope it resonates with other enthusiasts.

## Supported Games

The **Ratchet & Clank: Resurgence** project is currently in development, with **Ratchet & Clank: Q-Force** (known as **Full Frontal Assault** in North America) as the first game being modified. In the future, all other Ratchet & Clank titles on PS3 will be added to a tracking panel, allowing users to see the status of each game, whether itâ€™s being worked on, completed, or pending.

The panel will clearly display the status of each game, indicating those in progress and those not yet started. This will allow the community to follow the project's evolution in real-time.

## Game Development Status

## Installation Instructions

Full details on installing the mods will be provided once the first release is ready. In the meantime, here are the basic requirements:

- **Compatible PS3**: A PS3 Slim, Ultra Slim, or Fat with a jailbreak is necessary to install the mods.
- **Transfer Methods**: You will need either FTP access or a USB drive to transfer the modified files to your console.

I will provide detailed instructions to guide users step-by-step once the first version of the mod is available.

## Features & Updates

Specific features and improvements will be detailed after the tracking panel is set up. I plan to release regular updates to refine and enrich the content over time. Each update will bring new features, bug fixes, and general improvements. Development will be done step-by-step, with successive versions of the mod released as they are completed.

## Contributing

I review each proposed modification before integrating it into the project to ensure it aligns with the project's vision. For instance, cheats will not be accepted, as this is not the purpose of the project.
